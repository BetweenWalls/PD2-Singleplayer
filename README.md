## Inclusions
* level 99 characters for each class with accurate stats and skill points
* all unique/set items
* PD2-specific items (maps, worldstone shards, puzzleboxes, dclone materials, etc.)
* stacks of all runes/gems
* variety of jewels/charms
* many examples of runewords, and additional item bases for making your own
* many magic, rare, and crafted items

## Setup Guide
This uses a singleplayer mod called PlugY that implements a shared stash so that items can be organized and transferred between characters. Download [PlugY 11.02](http://plugy.free.fr/) (zip version) before beginning. PlugY also has some other useful quality-of-life features, so make sure to check out its readme file sometime.

1. Install Diablo II LoD
2. Install PD2
3. Install PlugY
* * copy PlugY.dll, PlugY.exe, PlugY.ini, and the PlugY 'readme' text file to your *Diablo II\ProjectD2* directory
* * copy the PlugY folder and its contents (11 files) to your *Diablo II* directory
4. Install this collection
* * Replace PlugY.ini in your *Diablo II\ProjectD2* directory with the version included here
* * Copy the files from the included Save folder to your *Diablo II\Save* directory
5. Run PD2 as you would normally to get the latest patch/update
6. Run PlugY.exe for singleplayer

## Stash Organization
The shared stash has multiple pages and can be navigated in increments of 1, 10, or 100 pages at a time. So far, the stash is organized as follows:

* (1-9) **Common Stuff**
* * empty page (for dumping items quickly or storing whatever's currently being tested)
* * workstation (maps, uber materials, corrupting materials)
* * runes & gems
* * special items (unique charms, cubes, tokens, etc.)
* * amulets & rings
* * jewels
* (10-39) **Charms**
* * resistance charms
* * damage charms
* * skillers for each class
* (40-49) **Base Items**
* (50-59) **Example Items**
* * magic, rare, & crafted items
* * runewords
* (60-69) **Uniques - Class-Specific**
* (70-89) **Uniques - Armor**
* (90-129) **Uniques - Weapons**
* (130-169) **Sets**
