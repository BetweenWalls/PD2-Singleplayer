### S5 Balance QoL
Author: BetweenWalls

Includes several balance and quality-of-life updates for season 5:
  * Several charm affixes (MF, resists, flat phys) balanced according to how many inventory spaces the charm requires, using small charms as the standard
  * Armor Bases:
    * Armor defense values balanced according to their strength requirements
    * Unique/set armor ED values adjusted accordingly to minimize changes
    * Strength requirements and block chance adjusted slightly for some items
  * Recipe Modifications:
    * Improved file organization - descriptions are more accurate/readable and similar recipes are grouped next to eachother
    * Up to 48 flawless gems can now be combined simultaneously into perfect gems
    * Set staves now correctly gain extra FCR when upgraded
    * 2 quivers of the same rarity and type (arrows or bolts) can be turned into a quiver of the opposite type
    * Runes can now be downgraded at a 1:1 ratio by cubing them with an Orb of Destruction
  * Other Modifications:
    * Added splash damage as an automod to staves (unique/set staves already have it)
    * Added 30% faster cast rate to ribcracker to match staff automod
    * Ormus' Robes can roll any non-mastery sorceress skill, Spiritkeeper can roll any druid skill
