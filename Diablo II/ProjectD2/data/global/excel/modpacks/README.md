### PD2 Modpacks
The folders in this directory each correspond to a separate text-based modpack for PD2, with the files of each 
modpack being the text files that would normally appear in the folder "Diablo II\ProjectD2\data\global\excel".

Each modpack has a "README" file that describes the modifications it makes.

To use a modpack's files, simply remove any other text files in the above folder and then copy the modpack's files into it. 
When the game is launched with "-direct -txt" as additional parameters, the text files there will supercede the defaults. 
The "testing" modpack is setup in this way by default.

The text files are tab-delineated, so they're best viewed in a column-based spreadsheet program such as Excel.
For an explanation of what each column refers to, see: https://d2mods.info/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=34455

If you'd like your own PD2 modpack to be available here, feel free to use github to make a pull request which includes it, or just message me directly.
