The folders in the same directory as this "README" file each correspond to a separate text-based mod for PD2, with the
files of each mod being the text files that would normally appear in the folder "Diablo II\ProjectD2\data\global\excel".

To use a mod's files, simply remove any other text files in the above folder and then copy the mod's files into it.
When the game is launched with "-direct -txt" as additional parameters, the text files there will supercede the defaults.
The "testing" mod is setup in this way by default.

Each mod folder should contain a "_INFO" file that describes the mod.
For example, "official\_INFO" says that it just includes the official PD2 files without any modifications (for reference).

The text files are tab-delineated, so they're best viewed in a column-based spreadsheet program such as Excel.
For an explanation of what each column refers to, see: https://d2mods.info/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=34455

If you'd like your own PD2 mod to be available here, feel free to use github to make a pull request which includes it, or just message me directly.
