Includes several balance and quality-of-life updates for season 4 (same as v1):
  * Several charm affixes balanced according to how many inventory spaces the charm requires, using small charms as the standard
  * Armor Bases:
    * Armor defense values balanced according to their strength requirements (52% of bases affected)
    * Block chance for paladin shields balanced
    * Strength requirements adjusted slightly for Heavy/Sharkskin/Vampirebone Gloves and Light/Sharkskin/Vampirefang Belts
    * Unique/set armor ED values adjusted accordingly to minimize changes
  * Recipe Modifications:
    * Improved file organization - descriptions are more accurate/readable and similar recipes are grouped next to eachother
    * Up to 48 flawless gems can now be combined simultaneously into perfect gems
    * Set staves now correctly gain extra FCR when upgraded
    * Puzzlebox can no longer be used with throwing weapons
    * 2 quivers of the same rarity and type (arrows or bolts) can be turned into a quiver of the opposite type
  * Other Modifications:
    * Added 20% deadly strike to infernal spike (set dagger) to match dagger automod
    * Added 30% faster cast rate to ribcracker to match staff automod
    * Added splash damage as an automod to staves (unique/set staves already have it)
    * Ormus' Robes can roll any non-mastery sorceress skill, Spiritkeeper can roll any druid skill

This version (v2) also includes changes to weapon bases.
They're separated since the changed weapons are incompatible with older versions of the same weapons.
  * Quest weapons fixed to be consistent with other items (automods, max sockets, range, str/dex bonus, upgrading, etc)
  * Weapon Bases:
    * Weapon base damage values balanced (25% of bases affected)
    * Weapon base speed values adjusted slightly for Archon Staff and Hand Axe/Hatchet/Tomahawk
    * Unique/set weapon ED values adjusted accordingly to minimize changes
