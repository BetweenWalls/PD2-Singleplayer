Includes several developer-style cube recipes to assist in testing:
  * reroll any non-crafted item with Horadrim Orb
  * use crafted items as ingredients for crafting recipes
  * generate set/unique items of a given base with Rancid (green) or Oil (gold) Potions
  * upgrade regular/magic item bases with Zakarum Orb
  * make items ethereal with Cartographer's Orb
  * upgrade regular item quality with Arcane Orb, and downgrade with Orb of Destruction
  * safely remove socketed gems/runes/jewels with Hel Rune
  * set the number of sockets with runes #1-6 based on the number of the rune used
  
Most changes are in "CubeMain.txt". "UniqueItems.txt" is just modified to ensure uniques aren't limited to one per game (so they can be rerolled multiple times)
